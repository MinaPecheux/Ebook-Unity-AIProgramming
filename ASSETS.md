## 4. 2D A* Pathfinder by pixelfac

<u>_Chapter 8_</u>'s unit movement relies on a slightly adapted version of "pixelfac"'s 2D A* pathfinding algorithm for Unity tilemaps, available for free on Github over here: [https://github.com/pixelfac/2D-Astar-Pathfinding-in-Unity](https://github.com/pixelfac/2D-Astar-Pathfinding-in-Unity).

Here, I've re-organised a few objects and allowed for the pathfinder to prepare the map of walkable and non-walkable areas in advance and cache it for further computations (instead of recomputing it each time like in the original implementation).

## 5. _Cryo's Mini GUI_ by PaperHatLizard

This nice little pack of UI elements by "PaperHatLizard" is available for free on [itch.io](https://itch.io/) under the **CC BY-NC 4.0** license (more info [here](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode)): [https://paperhatlizard.itch.io/cryos-mini-gui](https://paperhatlizard.itch.io/cryos-mini-gui).
